If you really really think we aren't, shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:moechat@sauyon.com">moechat@sauyon.com</a>. I appreciate it, I think. Also, a note to trolls: please at least use an email I can reply to. Getting replies makes trolling that much more fun, I promise. I also <b>promise</b> that I won't use your email to sign up for random spam sites.</p></div>
